1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the frontend.
2. Enter a YouTube URL in the provided input field and click the "Download" button.
3. The result section will display a message indicating that the download is being processed.

## Code Quality and Best Practices

- The code is well-organized and commented where necessary.
- Proper naming conventions are followed.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for downloading videos in different formats (e.g., MP4, WebM).
- Connect the frontend to the backend for actual download processing.
- Improve the UI/UX with better design and interactivity.
- Add validation and error handling for the URL input.
