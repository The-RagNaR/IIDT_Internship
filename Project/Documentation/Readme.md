## Introduction

The YouTube Video Downloader project aims to develop a web application that allows users to download YouTube videos by providing a URL. This project is built using Django for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient interface for users to download their desired videos.

## Problem Statement

With the increasing consumption of video content, there is a growing need for users to download videos for offline viewing. Current solutions are often cumbersome or come with restrictions. This project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient method to download YouTube videos, addressing the need for an accessible offline viewing experience.

## Tools and Technologies Used

    Backend Framework: Django
    Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Database: SQLite
    Version Control: Git
    Package Manager: pip
    IDEs: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm

## Existing System

Currently, users rely on various third-party applications and websites to download YouTube videos. These solutions often have limitations, such as download restrictions, ads, and potential security risks. Additionally, many of these services are not user-friendly and require multiple steps to download a single video.

## Proposed System

The proposed system is a web-based application that simplifies the process of downloading YouTube videos. By providing a user-friendly interface, users can input a YouTube URL and quickly obtain a download link. The application will handle the complexities of video downloading in the background, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of the YouTube Video Downloader project is divided into three main components:

    Client (Browser):
        Interacts with the user.
        Sends HTTP requests to the server.
        Displays the user interface and download links.

    Django Server:
        Handles incoming HTTP requests.
        Manages URL routing, business logic, and template rendering.
        Interacts with the database to store and retrieve video information.

    Database (SQLite):
        Stores video data including URLs, titles, descriptions, and download links.
        Ensures data integrity and supports SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.

## Database Schema

The database schema for the project consists of the following table:

        Video Table:
        
        Column          |  Data Type    | Constraints
        ----------------|---------------|----------------
        id              |  INTEGER      | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
        url             |  TEXT         | NOT NULL
        title           |  TEXT         | NOT NULL
        description     |  TEXT         |
        download_link   |  TEXT         | NOT NULL

## Database Implementation

### Database Models (models.py)

    from django.db import models

    class Video(models.Model):
        url = models.URLField()
        title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        description = models.TextField()
        download_link = models.URLField()

        def __str__(self):
            return self.title

### SQL for Creating Tables

    CREATE TABLE Video (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        url TEXT NOT NULL,
        title TEXT NOT NULL,
        description TEXT,
        download_link TEXT NOT NULL
    );

### Sample Data

    INSERT INTO Video (url, title, description, download_link) VALUES
    ('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example1', 'Example Video 1', 'This is an example video.', 'http://example.com/download1'),
    ('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example2', 'Example Video 2', 'This is another example video.', 'http://example.com/download2'),
    ('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example3', 'Example Video 3', 'Description for video 3', 'http://example.com/download3');

## SQL Queries

### Data Manipulation Queries

    1. Insert Data:

        INSERT INTO Video (url, title, description, download_link) VALUES ('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example4', 'Example Video 4', 'Description for video 4', 'http://example.com/download4');

    2. Update Data:

        UPDATE Video SET title = 'Updated Video Title' WHERE id = 1;

    3. Delete Data:

        DELETE FROM Video WHERE id = 3;

### Data Retrieval Queries

    1. Select All Videos:

        SELECT * FROM Video;

    2. Select Video by ID:

        SELECT * FROM Video WHERE id = 1;

    3. Select Videos with Specific Title:

        SELECT * FROM Video WHERE title LIKE '%Example%';

    4. Count Videos:

        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Video;

    5. Join and Group Videos:

        SELECT title, COUNT(*) FROM Video GROUP BY title;

### Complex Queries

    1. Subquery:

        SELECT * FROM Video WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM Video WHERE title LIKE '%Example%');

    2. Advanced Query:

        SELECT * FROM Video WHERE title IN (SELECT title FROM Video GROUP BY title HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
